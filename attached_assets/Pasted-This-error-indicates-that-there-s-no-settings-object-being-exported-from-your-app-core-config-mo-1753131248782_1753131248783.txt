This error indicates that there's no `settings` object being exported from your `app.core.config` module. The import is failing because `settings` doesn't exist in that file.

Here are the most common causes and solutions:

## 1. Missing Settings Instance

Your `config.py` file likely defines a `Settings` class but doesn't create an instance. You need to add:

```python
# In app/core/config.py
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
from pydantic import BaseModel

class CacheSettings(BaseModel):
    cache_ttl_sec: int = 3600

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # Your configuration fields here
    cache: CacheSettings = CacheSettings()
    
    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"
        env_file_encoding = "utf-8"

# Create the settings instance - this is what's missing!
settings = Settings()
```

## 2. Check Your Current config.py File

Can you show me the current content of your `app/core/config.py` file? The issue is likely one of these:

- No `settings = Settings()` line
- The settings instance has a different name
- There's a syntax error preventing the file from loading
- Import errors within the config file itself

## 3. Temporary Debug Solution

To quickly identify the issue, temporarily add some debug prints to your config.py:

```python
# At the top of app/core/config.py
print("Loading config.py...")

# Your Settings class definition here
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # ... your config

# At the bottom
print("Creating settings instance...")
settings = Settings()
print("Settings created successfully!")
```

## 4. Alternative Quick Fix

If you need to get the app running quickly, create a minimal config file:

```python
# In app/core/config.py
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
from pydantic import BaseModel

class CacheSettings(BaseModel):
    cache_ttl_sec: int = 3600

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    cache: CacheSettings = CacheSettings()
    
    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"

settings = Settings()
```

Can you share the current content of your `config.py` file? That will help me provide a more specific solution. The error suggests the file exists but doesn't export a `settings` object that other modules are trying to import.
